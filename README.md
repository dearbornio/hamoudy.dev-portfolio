Originally started off as just a MySpace page to showcase my skills and eventually I added my own chatbot on there. So now it's a chat page with a link to the MySpace. The music player on the profile page works!

HTML, CCS, and some Javascript used for the websites. The main page was designed by ChatGPT.

The Chatbot was made using Flowise/LangChain. A short biography of mine was provided and a prompt created by the OG Chat GPT was used to help give it some character.
